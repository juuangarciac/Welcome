# My Portfolio

Hi! I'm Juan Garcia, a Computer Science student specializing in IT. This is my portfolio, where I share some of my projects and skills.

## University Projects
### Terminal Applications
- [**E-commerce**](https://github.com/juuangarciac/es.uca.e-shop.cpp): Terminal application developed in *C++*. This application was part of my learning in *Object-Oriented Programming*, introducing me to concepts such as *Classes, Objects, Inheritance, and Polymorphism*.

### Web Development
- [**MyWineShop**](https://github.com/juuangarciac/es.uca.mywineshop.laravel): Web application developed with *Laravel*. This application was created as a practical project for the course *Internet and Electronic Business*. It is an **e-commerce** platform. Through the development of this application, I was introduced to the world of web development, which gave me my first knowledge of the *Model-View-Controller* architecture, web application development using the *PHP* programming language, database server connection, along with its corresponding management. I also gained knowledge of user interface development, using the **Bootstrap** framework, and of course the markup language on which the web is based, *HTML*.

- [**OMV (Virtual Mobile Operator) *MangoPhone***](https://github.com/Manuel-Coca/iw2023-2024-MangoPhone): Web application developed with *Vaadin and Spring Boot* and deployed on *AWS*. The *MangoPhone* platform was developed as a practical project for the course *Web Engineering*. This platform provides a *front-office* for customers and a *back-office* for employees. In the development of *MangoPhone*, I collaborated with different teammates, which gave me experience in teamwork, skills such as problem management, collaboration, leadership, and motivation. Additionally, I acquired technical knowledge in application development using frameworks based on the *Java* programming language and the *Layers* architecture. The application was deployed using the **Amazon Web Services** platform.

- [**VitaSnap**](https://github.com/juuangarciac/es.juuangarciac.vitasnap.java): VitaSnap was developed with the motivation to delve deeper into the concept of a **private API**. It was developed using the *SpringBoot* framework. A *React* application was also implemented to make requests to the API. Given the exponential growth of API usage as part of the architecture of any system, I felt compelled to enhance my knowledge in this area of web development. This led me to develop an *API protected with API keys* using the *SpringBoot* framework, as well as the functionalities provided by *SpringSecurity*, to ensure secure access to it.   

### DevOps
 - [DevOps Practices](https://github.com/juuangarciac/es.uca.practicasVS.devops): This repository hosts a set of practices carried out in the course *System Virtualization*, where various deployment tools such as *Azure Pipelines*, *GitLab*, *Terraform*, *Jenkins*, *Docker*, among others, are explored. Through these practices, I gained a solid understanding of containerization technology and its application in preparing system infrastructure that implements **CI/CD**. This approach represents a best practice for improving efficiency and collaboration within development teams.
